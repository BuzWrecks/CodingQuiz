## Description

This is a simple Coding Quiz built using JavaScript, with multiple choice questions. This was a project I really struggled with, and I am not wholly satisfied with it. There is a significant amount of code that I struggled to understand, I have linked to sources for assistance and inspiration in the credits section.
